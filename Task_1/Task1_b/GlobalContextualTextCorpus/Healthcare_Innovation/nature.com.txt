Heat-related deaths are estimated to increase more rapidly than cold-related deaths are estimated to decrease under future climate change scenarios across European cities. An unrealistic degree of adaptation to heat would be required to revert this trend, indicating the need for strong policies to reduce greenhouse gases emissions.

Generalist AI systems in healthcare can handle multiple complex clinical tasks, unlike narrow AI tools that perform isolated functions. However, current payment systems struggle to capture the value of these integrated capabilities. We examine potential solutions, including value-based and tiered structures, balancing innovation, equitable access, continuous performance evaluation, and cost-effectiveness to realize generalist AIs transformative potential. In a recently reported study, a novel engineered oncolytic Newcastle disease virus encoding porcine α1,3-galactosyltransferase was evaluated in monkeys with CRISPR-induced primary hepatocellular carcinoma and in a phase I clinical trial.

The virus induced hyperacute tumour rejection and an objective response rate of 35 in 20 evaluable patients. This approach highlights the promises and challenges of oncolytic virus drug development. Kidney disease disproportionately affects American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities, largely owing to adverse social drivers of health that stem from systemic issues including colonization, structural racism and historical trauma. Kidney health equity for AIAN communities requires systemic and multilevel interventions across the CKD spectrum and life course.

Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare promises substantial advancements but requires careful consideration of technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges. Closed LLMs of private companies offer ease of deployment but pose risks related to data privacy and vendor dependence. Open LLMs deployed on local hardware enable greater model customization but demand resources and technical expertise. Balancing these approaches, with collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and companies is crucial to ensure effective, secure, and ethical implementation.

Health economist Jay Bhattacharya, who drew censure for controversial views on COVID-19, vows to provide funding but is short on details. Studies that touch on LGBT health, gender identity and DEI in the biomedical workforce could be terminated, according to documents obtained by Nature. The scale of work to improve therapies for eye disease reflects the importance people place on sight.

The Athena lander seems to be in the wrong orientation  but some of its science might be salvaged. Neuroscientists demonstrate how specific neurons in the brainstem control these behavioural strategies in mice.

Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 releases T cells from immunosuppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2, thereby enhancing the immune response against metastasis. A temporary blackout of PubMed has researchers concerned over the databases future. Plus, a birds nest offers a time capsule of plastic rubbish.

The Athena lander seems to be in the wrong orientation  but some of its science might be salvaged. Current approaches to pain relief are falling short. Chemically modifying a synthetic cannabinoid could enable scientists to capitalize on the bodys natural pain-killing pathway without evoking drug tolerance or psychoactivity. QLEDs  light-emitting diodes that rely on nanocrystals called quantum dots  are usually made with toxic heavy metals.

A strategy has been developed to make QLEDs with a performance comparable to that of commercially available technologies but using a more environmentally friendly alloy of zinc, selenium, tellurium and sulfur, by improving the distribution of the tellurium atoms. To survive, animals must continually decide whether to persevere with their current goal, switch to a new one or disengage altogether. Three genetically defined types of neuronal cell in a small midbrain area called the median raphe nucleus are shown to control decisions about whether to persevere, explore or disengage. A compilation of genomes from species in the genus Solanum could help scientists to blend the best aspects of productive staple crops and genetically diverse but under-studied indigenous crops.

Nitrogen-isotope analysis provides geochemical evidence that, similar to modern corals, some extinct coral groups had a symbiotic association with photosynthetic microorganisms. This photosymbiosis might have contributed to the high productivity of ancient reefs in low-nutrient environments and puts long-term ecological research on ancient reefs into a fresh perspective. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 releases T cells from immunosuppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A2, thereby enhancing the immune response against metastasis. By suppressing compositional heterogeneities in cadmium-free quantum dots, environmentally friendly pure-blue-light-emitting diodes with enhanced efficiencies, lifetimes and spectral purity are achieved, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue quantum-dot light-emitting diodes.

Analysis of gravitational waves from merging binary neutron stars was accelerated using machine learning, enabling full low-latency parameter estimation and enhancing the potential for multi-messenger observations. cAMP produced by the TIR1AFB receptors of the main endogenous developmental plant hormone auxin acts as a true second messenger, revising the established paradigm of transcriptional auxin signalling.
