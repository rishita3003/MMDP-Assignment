However, the decarbonisation of the energy sector requires urgent action on a global scale to accelerate the global energy transition and realise both national and regional commitments. IRENAs World energy transitions outlook charts an evolving pathway to achieving a climate-safe future in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Its 1.5C pathway offers a roadmap for accelerating the global energy transition by positioning electrification and efficiency as key drivers of change, backed by renewables, hydrogen and sustainable biomass.

An aggressive energy efficiency strategy, combined with the ramping up of renewables to replace fossil fuels, is the most realistic path towards halving emissions by 2030. Yet phasing out fossil fuels is a complex task for countries heavily reliant on coal - especially given the imperatives of a just and fair transition for workers and communities. Concerted action and international co-operation are therefore essential for timely progress. The 1.5C Scenario will require investments of USD 5.7 trillion per year until 2030. Investment decisions are long-lived and the risks of stranded assets are high, so decisions must be guided by long-term logic.

The World energy transitions outlook estimates that USD 0.7 trillion in annual investments in fossil fuels should be redirected towards energy transition technologies. While most of the additional capital is expected to come from the private sector, a doubling of public financing will be required to catalyse private finance and create an enabling environment for a transition that brings optimal socio-economic gains, including transition-related jobs and GDP. Furthermore, a comprehensive set of policies covering all technological avenues is needed to achieve the necessary levels of deployment by 2030. Only a holistic global policy framework can bring countries together to orchestrate a just transition that strengthens international finance flows, capacities and technologies, and leaves no one behind. In turn, progressive policy and regulatory measures will generate greater benefits from the energy transition for all peoples, nations and regions of the world.

IRENAs 1.5C Scenario, set out in the World Energy Transitions Outlook, presents a pathway to achieve the 1.5C target by 2050, positioning electrification and efficiency as key transition drivers, enabled by renewable energy, clean hydrogen and sustainable biomass. Representing core components of its global outlook, the Agencys regional energy transition outlooks provide a more nuanced exploration of both the technical potential and the socio-economic benefits of the energy transition at the regional level. Drawing on analyses of renewable energy markets, employment, innovation, costs and capacities, these serve as the basis for informed development strategies and strengthened regional cooperation to both accelerate the progress toward, and maximise the benefits from, the global transition to renewables. IRENAS country-level studies comprise renewable energy roadmaps, readiness assessments, individual socio-economic analyses and transition outlooks that form the foundations of its regional and global perspectives. Providing practical and actionable recommendations, backed by extensive data and knowledge, these products serve as the basis for informed decision-making at the national level to support and advance the global energy transition.

Important message for WDS users We work with a broad range of international organisations and forums to ensure secure, affordable and sustainable energy systems Our technology programme provides the basis for international public and private research partnerships We help ensure a quick and effective response to energy supply disruptions through emergency response measures and other mechanisms We carry out training activities around the world on energy statistics, modelling, technology, energy efficiency and policies for clean energy transitions Executive Director Executive Director As the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, Dr Fatih Birol (fbirol) has moved the Agency to the forefront of global efforts to ensure secure, affordable and sustainable energy systems. After taking office, Dr Birol led the IEA in its first comprehensive modernisation programme since its creation in 1974. These efforts focused on broadening the IEAs energy security focus beyond oil to also cover electricity, natural gas, renewables and critical minerals; making the IEA the global hub for energy efficiency and advanced energy technologies; and opening the doors of the IEA to major emerging economies.

With new governments joining the IEA Family under his tenure, its share of global energy demand has risen from 40 to almost 80. Dr Birol took up his position after rising through the ranks of the IEA over two decades. He has been named in the TIME100, TIME's annual list of the world's most influential people. He has also been named by Forbes as one of the most influential people in the world of energy and by the Financial Times as the Energy Personality of the Year.

Dr Birol has received the highest civilian awards from numerous countries around the world for his work on energy economics and related issues. He chairs the World Economic Forums (Davos) Energy Advisory Board. Before the IEA, Dr Birol worked at the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). He earned a BSc degree in power engineering from the Technical University of Istanbul and received an MSc and PhD in energy economics from the Technical University of Vienna.

He is an honorary life member of Galatasaray Football Club.
