Technology  Artificial intelligence Yuval Noah Harari October 1, 2024 Stories can unify or divide but our ability to imagine them is uniquely human.

Cooperation and trust, built through shared stories and narratives, are the foundation of human societies and economies. So what happens when humans no longer hold the pen? Yuval Noah Harari is a historian, philosopher, and author. In this podcast, Harari says artificial intelligence is a risk to humankinds most valuable resource, trust.

Technology  Fintech Jim Tebrake January 23, 2024 As the global economy becomes increasingly digitalized, effective policy and regulation are critical to ensure a stable and equitable financial system. Jim Tebrake is Deputy Director and heads the data and methodology efforts in the IMF Statistics Department.

Technology  Artificial intelligence MARYAM VAZIRI, ANDREW BERG December 7, 2023 The pace at which artificial intelligence is transforming jobs is astounding, but while it boasts higher productivity AI is also increasing wage inequality.

When workers are replaced by machines, real wages decline, and the owners of capital prosper. So who owns AI and how should its benefits be distributed? The IMFs Andrew Berg and Maryam Vaziri discuss AIs inequality problem. FD Magazine OREN CASS March 3, 2025 Modern economics was built on ideas spelled out by Adam Smith in his 18th-century The Wealth of Nations.

But while he used the term only once in that voluminous economic treatise, Smith is most remembered for the invisible hand, a metaphor that Oren Cass says has wrongly been associated with the idea that markets magically self-correct. Cass is the founder and chief economist at American Compass. In this podcast, he says the contortion of Smiths idea led to a blind faith in markets, whereas the invisible hand was really about ensuring the alignment between private profit and the public interest. FD Magazine SANJEEV GUPTA February 25, 2025 The pandemic was a brutal reminder of how crucial public health systems are, yet health budgets in developing economies are still underfunded.

Raworth is an ecological economist and the author of Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st Century Economist. Women In Economics  Development Una Osili May 21, 2024 When disaster strikes, the knee-jerk reaction is to seek public funds for support, but private donors have the agility that governments often dont. Una Osili holds the Efroymson Chair in Philanthropy at Indiana University and believes Africa would benefit from more private donors and more African women to manage it.

In this podcast, Rhoda Metcalfe asks Dr. Osili about her work and why there arent more women economists on the continent.

Journalist Rhoda Metcalfe spoke with Juliet Schor about her four-day week mission, as part of our special Women in Economics series.

Financial Stability  Financial sector stability Jason Wu, Nassira Abbas October 22, 2024 As inflation and interest rates continue to decline and the likelihood of a recession slowly fades, the latest Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) warns of several factors that could upend the recovery, including the disconnect between market buoyancy and heightened uncertainty. Jason Wu and Nassira Abbas lead the IMFs work on financial stability. In this podcast, they say while the near-term risks appear contained, medium-term prospects remain a concern.

In this podcast, they say implementing reforms that create suﬃcient jobs will improve prospects for the region. Outlooks Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas May 2, 2024 The World Economic Outlook is more than projected growth rates. The research behind those projections tells the story of how 190 countries, slowly but steadily, found their way through the fog of the past few years to emerge a testament to the resilience of the global economy.

IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas says the fears of a global recession have not materialized but the path ahead is not without obstacles. Outlooks WENJIE CHEN April 25, 2024 Sub-Saharan Africa is slowly emerging from four turbulent years with higher growth expected for nearly two thirds of countries. But while inflation has almost halved and debt has broadly stabilized, economies still face financing shortages and impending debt repayments. Wenjie Chen is deputy head of the team that publishes the Regional Economic Outlook for sub-Saharan Africa.

In this podcast, she says the surging global demand for minerals could help the region overcome the ongoing funding squeeze. Outlooks  Inflation Frederik Toscani August 3, 2023 While import prices account for much of Europes inflation, its outlook largely depends on how companies absorb wage gains as higher prices erode workers purchasing power. IMF economist Frederik Toscani says corporate profits account for 45 percent of price rises since the start of 2022.
