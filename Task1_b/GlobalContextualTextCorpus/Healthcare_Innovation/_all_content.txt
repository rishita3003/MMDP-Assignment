Heat-related deaths are estimated to increase more rapidly than cold-related deaths are estimated to decrease under future climate change scenarios across European cities.

An unrealistic degree of adaptation to heat would be required to revert this trend, indicating the need for strong policies to reduce greenhouse gases emissions. Generalist AI systems in healthcare can handle multiple complex clinical tasks, unlike narrow AI tools that perform isolated functions. However, current payment systems struggle to capture the value of these integrated capabilities. We examine potential solutions, including value-based and tiered structures, balancing innovation, equitable access, continuous performance evaluation, and cost-effectiveness to realize generalist AIs transformative potential.

In a recently reported study, a novel engineered oncolytic Newcastle disease virus encoding porcine Î±1,3-galactosyltransferase was evaluated in monkeys with CRISPR-induced primary hepatocellular carcinoma and in a phase I clinical trial. The virus induced hyperacute tumour rejection and an objective response rate of 35 in 20 evaluable patients. This approach highlights the promises and challenges of oncolytic virus drug development.

Kidney disease disproportionately affects American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities, largely owing to adverse social drivers of health that stem from systemic issues including colonization, structural racism and historical trauma. Kidney health equity for AIAN communities requires systemic and multilevel interventions across the CKD spectrum and life course. Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare promises substantial advancements but requires careful consideration of technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges. Closed LLMs of private companies offer ease of deployment but pose risks related to data privacy and vendor dependence. Open LLMs deployed on local hardware enable greater model customization but demand resources and technical expertise.

Balancing these approaches, with collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and companies is crucial to ensure effective, secure, and ethical implementation. Health economist Jay Bhattacharya, who drew censure for controversial views on COVID-19, vows to provide funding but is short on details. Studies that touch on LGBT health, gender identity and DEI in the biomedical workforce could be terminated, according to documents obtained by Nature.

Chemically modifying a synthetic cannabinoid could enable scientists to capitalize on the bodys natural pain-killing pathway without evoking drug tolerance or psychoactivity. QLEDs  light-emitting diodes that rely on nanocrystals called quantum dots  are usually made with toxic heavy metals.
