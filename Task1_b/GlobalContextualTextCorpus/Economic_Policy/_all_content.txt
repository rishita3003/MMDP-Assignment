Technology  Artificial intelligence Yuval Noah Harari October 1, 2024 Stories can unify or divide but our ability to imagine them is uniquely human. Cooperation and trust, built through shared stories and narratives, are the foundation of human societies and economies. So what happens when humans no longer hold the pen?

Yuval Noah Harari is a historian, philosopher, and author. In this podcast, Harari says artificial intelligence is a risk to humankinds most valuable resource, trust. Technology  Fintech Jim Tebrake January 23, 2024 As the global economy becomes increasingly digitalized, effective policy and regulation are critical to ensure a stable and equitable financial system.

Technology  Artificial intelligence MARYAM VAZIRI, ANDREW BERG December 7, 2023 The pace at which artificial intelligence is transforming jobs is astounding, but while it boasts higher productivity AI is also increasing wage inequality.

But while he used the term only once in that voluminous economic treatise, Smith is most remembered for the invisible hand, a metaphor that Oren Cass says has wrongly been associated with the idea that markets magically self-correct. Cass is the founder and chief economist at American Compass. In this podcast, he says the contortion of Smiths idea led to a blind faith in markets, whereas the invisible hand was really about ensuring the alignment between private profit and the public interest.
