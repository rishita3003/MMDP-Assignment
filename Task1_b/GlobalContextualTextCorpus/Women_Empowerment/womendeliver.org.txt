We advance the health and rights of adolescent girls by creating spaces for collective action, championing and supporting youth advocacy, and convening likeminded organizations. In everything we do, we aim to shift power into the hands of those closest to and living the challenges that girls face. Our mission is to ensure that every girl and every woman has control over her body and her life. We do this by focusing on securing and advancing the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of girls during adolescence as a critical period that impacts the course of their lives. ""
