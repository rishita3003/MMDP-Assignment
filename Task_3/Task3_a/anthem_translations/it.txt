Italian Brothers, Italy has awakened, She has wreathed her head With the helmet of Scipio. Where is Victory? She bows her head to you, You, whom God created As the slave of Rome. Let us band together, We are ready to die, We are ready to die, Italy has called us. Let us band together, We are ready to die, We are ready to die, Italy has called us! (Yes!) We were for centuries Downtrodden and derided, because we are not one people, because we are divided. Let one flag, one hope gather us all. The hour has struck for us to join together. Let us unite and love one another, Union and love Show the people The way of the Lord. Let us swear to free Our native soil; United under God, Who can defeat us? From the Alps  to Sicily, Legnano is everywhere; Every man has the heart and hand of Ferruccio The children of Italy Are all called Balilla; Every trumpet blast sounds the Vespers. Mercenary swords, theyâ€™re feeble reeds. The Austrian eagle Has already lost its plumes. The blood of Italy and the Polish blood It drank, along with the Cossack, But it burned its heart.
