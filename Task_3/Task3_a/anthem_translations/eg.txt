My homeland, my homeland, my homeland, My love and my heart are for thee. My homeland, my homeland, my homeland, My love and my heart are for thee. Egypt! O mother of all lands, My hope and my ambition, How can one count The blessings of the Nile for mankind? Egypt! Most precious jewel, Shining on the brow of eternity! O my homeland, be for ever free, Safe from every foe! Egypt! Noble are thy children, Loyal, and guardians of thy soil. In war and peace We give our lives for thy sake.
