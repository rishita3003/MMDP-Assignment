A treasure is our tongue that surges From deep shadows of the past, Chain of precious stones that scattered All over our ancient land. A burning flame is our tongue Amidst a people waking From a deathly sleep, no warning, Like the brave man of the stories. Our tongue is the greenest leaf Of the everlasting forests, Gentle river Nistruâ€™s ripples Hiding starlight bright and shining. Our tongue is more than holy, Words of homilies of old Wept and sung perpetually In the homesteads of our folks. A treasure will spring up swiftly From deep shadows of the past, Chain of precious stones that scattered All over our ancient land.
