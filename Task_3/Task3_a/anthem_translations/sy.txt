Defenders of the realm, Peace on you; Our proud spirits will Not be subdued. The abode of Arabism, A hallowed sanctuary; The seat of the stars, An inviolable preserve. Syriaâ€™s plains are Towers in the heights, Resembling the sky Above the clouds. A land resplendant With brilliant suns, Becoming another sky, Or almost a sky.
