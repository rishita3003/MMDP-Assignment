Arise, Congolese, united by fate, United in the struggle for independence, Let us hold up our heads, so long bowed, And now, for good, let us keep moving boldly ahead, in peace. Oh, ardent people, by hard work we shall build, In peace, a country more beautiful than before. Countrymen, sing the sacred hymn of your solidarity, Proudly salute the golden emblem of your soverignity, Congo. Blessed gift of our forefathers , Oh country that we love , We shall people your soil and ensure your greatness. Oh gentle sun of 30th June, Be witness of the immortal oath of freedom That we hand on to our children for ever.
