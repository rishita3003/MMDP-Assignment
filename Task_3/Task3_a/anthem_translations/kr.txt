Until that day when the waters of the Eastern Sea run dry
and Mt. Baekdu is worn away, God protect and preserve our nation. Three thousand Li of splendid rivers and mountains, filled with Roses of Sharon; Great Korean people, stay true to the Great Korean way! As the pine atop Mt. Namsan stands firm, as if wrapped in armour, unchanged through wind and frost, so shall our resilient spirit. The Autumn sky is void and vast, high and cloudless; the bright moon is our heart, undivided and true. With this spirit and this mind, give all loyalty, in suffering or in joy, to the love of country.
