All humanity, moans within its chains, understands the words of He who died on the Cross. “Independence!” cries the American world; soaked in blood of heroes the land of Columbus. Still, one great principle, “The king is not sovereign”, resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. The Orinoco’s bed fills with the remains, of blood and tears a river is there seen flowing. In Bárbula they don’t know the souls nor the eyes, if admiration or horror feel or suffer.

From Boyacá in the fields, the genius of glory, for every ear a hero undefeated crowned. Soldiers without breastplate won victory; their virile breath as shield served. Bolivar crosses the Andes that two oceans bathe, swords as sparks shine in Junín. Untameable centaurs descend to the plains, and a prescience begins to be felt, of the epic the end. The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho thunders, that in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is worn for the first time, from the American sky a pavilion forming. The virgin her hairs pulls out in agony and from her beloved widowed hangs them on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes are breaking forth; constellation of cyclops its night brightened. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. But it’s not complete glory to defeat in battle, that the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. Independence alone The great clamour doesn’t silence; if the sun illuminates everyone, justice is liberty. From men the rights Nariño’s preaching, the soul of struggle prophetically taught.

All humanity, moans within its chains, understands the words of He who died on the Cross. “Independence!” cries the American world; soaked in blood of heroes the land of Columbus. Still, one great principle, “The king is not sovereign”, resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. The Orinoco’s bed fills with the remains, of blood and tears a river is there seen flowing. In Bárbula they don’t know the souls nor the eyes, if admiration or horror feel or suffer.

From Boyacá in the fields, the genius of glory, for every ear a hero undefeated crowned. Soldiers without breastplate won victory; their virile breath as shield served. Bolivar crosses the Andes that two oceans bathe, swords as sparks shine in Junín. Untameable centaurs descend to the plains, and a prescience begins to be felt, of the epic the end. The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho thunders, that in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is worn for the first time, from the American sky a pavilion forming. The virgin her hairs pulls out in agony and from her beloved widowed hangs them on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes are breaking forth; constellation of cyclops its night brightened. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. But it’s not complete glory to defeat in battle, that the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. Independence alone The great clamour doesn’t silence; if the sun illuminates everyone, justice is liberty. From men the rights Nariño’s preaching, the soul of struggle prophetically taught.

No country deserves to be free If it is an indolent and servile slave, If the call does not grow loud within it, Tempered by a virile heroism. But the brave and indomitable Quisqueya Will always hold its head high, For if it were a thousand times enslaved, It would a thousand times regain liberty. If it will be exposed to ruse and deceit Unto contempt of a real imposer, On to Las Carreras! Beler! …it were places Where the traces of glory are found. Where on the top of the heroic bastion, The word of the libarated became flesh, Where the genius of Sánchez and Duarte Taught to be free or to die. And if an unattended leader the splendor Of these glorious events could ignore, One has seen in Capotillo in the war The flag of fire wave. And the fire that lets the proud lion Of Castilla become stupefied, Removes him from the glorious beaches Where the crossed banner waves. Compatriots, let us proudly Show our face, from today prouder than ever; Quisqueya may be destroyed But a slave again, never! It is a sanctuary of love that every character Of the fatherland feels alive! And it is his coat of arms, the right; And it is his device: be free or die. Liberty that still rises cool-bloodedly The victory in her triumphal car. And the clarion of war re-echoes Proclaiming his immortal glory. Liberty! That the echo’s touch While they’re full of noble tension Our fields of glory repeat Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!\"\n",

      "pe,Peru,\"We are free! May we always be so, may we always be so! and let the sun rather deny its light its lights, its lights…the sun! Before allow us to break the solemn vow which the motherland elevated to the Eternal Before allow us to break the solemn vow which the motherland elevated to the Eternal Before allow us to break the solemn vow which the motherland elevated to the Eternal. For a long time the oppressed Peruvian dragged the ominous chain; sentenced to a cruel servitude for a long time, for a long time for a long time in silence he moaned. But as soon as the sacred cry “Liberty!” was heard on its coasts, he shook off the indolence of slavery, the humiliated, the humiliated the humiliated neck he raised the humiliated neck he raised the neck he raised!. Now the roar of rough chains that we had heard for three centuries of horror from the free, at the sacred cry that the world heard astonished, ceased. Everywhere the inflamed San Martín “Liberty”, “Liberty” pronounced; and the Andes, rocking their base, announced it as well, in unison. With its influx the peoples woke up, and like lighting ran the opinion; from the Isthmus to Tierra del Fuego, and from Tierra del Fuego to the icy region. Everyone vowed to break the link that Nature denied to both worlds, and break the sceptre that Spain had reclined, proud, on both. Lima fulfilled this solemn vow, and, severe, her anger showed by throwing out the powerless tyrant, who had been trying to extend his oppression. On her endeavor the shackles cracked, and the furrows that she had repaired in herself stirred up her hatred and vengeance, inherited from her Inca and Lord. Countrymen, may we see her a slave no more. If for three centuries she moaned, humiliated, forever may we vow that she be free, maintaining her own splendor. Our arms, until today unarmed, be they always readying the cannon, that some day the beaches of Iberia will feel the horror of its roar. May we arouse the jealousy of Spain since it has a premonition, with want and furor, that in a contest of great nations our country will enter in comparison. On the list formed by these we shall fill the line first, ahead of the ambitious Iberian tyrant, who devastated all of America. On its summit may the Andes sustain the two-color flag or standard, may it announce to the centuries the effort that being free gave us forever. Under its shadow may we live calmly and, at the sun’s birth over its summits, may we renew the great oath we rendered to the God of Jacob.\"\n",

And that, is the star of my nation, and it will forever shine; It is mine; and solely belongs to my nation. Frown not, I beseech you, oh thou coy crescent, But smile upon my heroic nation! Why the anger, why the rage? The blood we shed for you will not be worthy otherwise; For freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshipping nation. I have been free since the beginning and forever will be so. What madman shall put me in chains! I defy the very idea! I’m like the roaring flood; powerful and independent, I’ll tear apart mountains, exceed all that is known to Man, and still gush out! The lands of the West may be armored with walls of steel, But I have borders guarded by the mighty chest of a believer. Recognize your innate strength! And think: how can this fiery faith ever be killed, By that battered, single-toothed monster you call ? My friend! Leave not my homeland to the hands of villainous men! Render your chest as armor! Stop this disgraceful rush! For soon shall be come the day of promised freedom… Who knows? Perhaps tomorrow? Perhaps even sooner! See not the soil you tread on as mere earth, But think about the thousands beneath you that lie without even shrouds. You’re the noble son of a martyr, take shame, hurt not your ancestor! Unhand not, even when you’re promised worlds, this paradise of a homeland. What man would not die for this heavenly piece of land? Martyrs would gush out if you just squeeze the soil! Martyrs! May God take all my loved ones and possessions from me if he will, But may he not deprive me of my one true homeland for the world. O Lord, the sole wish of my heart is that, No infidel’s hand should touch the bosom of my temple. These adhans, the shahadah of which is the base of the religion, Shall sound loud over my eternal homeland. Then my tombstone – if there is one – will a thousand times in ecstasy, O Lord, tears of blood flowing out of my every wound, My corpse will gush out from the earth like a spirit, And then, my head will perhaps rise and reach the heavens. So flap and wave like the dawning sky, oh glorious crescent, So that our every last drop of blood may finally be worthy! Neither you nor my nation shall ever be extinguished! For freedom is the absolute right of my ever-free flag; For freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshipping nation!\"\n",

The horrible night has ceased, the sublime liberty spills the auroras of its invincible light. All humanity, moans within its chains, understands the words of He who died on the Cross. “Independence!” cries the American world; soaked in blood of heroes the land of Columbus. Still, one great principle, “The king is not sovereign”, resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. The Orinoco’s bed fills with the remains, of blood and tears a river is there seen flowing. In Bárbula they don’t know the souls nor the eyes, if admiration or horror feel or suffer. On the shores of the Caribbean, famished, the people fight, horrors preferring to treacherous health. O, aye! for Cartagena the abnegation is much, and the shambles of death its courage despises. From Boyacá in the fields, the genius of glory, for every ear a hero undefeated crowned. Soldiers without breastplate won victory; their virile breath as shield served. Bolivar crosses the Andes that two oceans bathe, swords as sparks shine in Junín. Untameable centaurs descend to the plains, and a prescience begins to be felt, of the epic the end. The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho thunders, that in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is worn for the first time, from the American sky a pavilion forming. The virgin her hairs pulls out in agony and from her beloved widowed hangs them on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes are breaking forth; constellation of cyclops its night brightened. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. But it’s not complete glory to defeat in battle, that the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. Independence alone The great clamour doesn’t silence; if the sun illuminates everyone, justice is liberty. From men the rights Nariño’s preaching, the soul of struggle prophetically taught. Ricaurte in San Mateo, in atoms flying, “Duty before life,” with flames he wrote.\n",

Like an Indian maiden you have been sleeping, Lulled by the resonant song of your seas, When, set in your golden valleys, The bold navigator found you; And on seeing, enraptured, your beauty, And feeling your enchantment, He dedicated a kiss of love to the blue hem of your splendid mantle. From a country where the sun rises, Beyond the blue Atlantic, That man who had dreamt you In search of you he launched to sea. When you raised your pale forehead, In the lively anxiousness of your hope, Under the gentle dome of your sky Already floated a strange banner.

For three centuries your children heard The imperious mandate of the master; For three centuries your useless complaint In the blue atmosphere was lost But one glorious day your ear Perceived, powerful and distant, That there, far away, over the Atlantic, Indignantly, a lion roared It was France, the free, the heroic, Which in its dreams of centuries slept, Awoke irate to life At the virile protest of Danton: It was France, who sent to the death The head of the consecrated King, And which built up proudly at its side, The altar of the goddess of Reason. You also, oh my country!, arose From your servile deep sleep; You also showed the world The infamous shackle destroyed. And in your blessed soil, behind the tall Hair of the wild jungle, Like a bird of black feathers, The fleeting colony was lost.

For a long time the oppressed Peruvian dragged the ominous chain; sentenced to a cruel servitude for a long time, for a long time for a long time in silence he moaned. But as soon as the sacred cry “Liberty!” was heard on its coasts, he shook off the indolence of slavery, the humiliated, the humiliated the humiliated neck he raised the humiliated neck he raised the neck he raised!. Now the roar of rough chains that we had heard for three centuries of horror from the free, at the sacred cry that the world heard astonished, ceased. Everywhere the inflamed San Martín “Liberty”, “Liberty” pronounced; and the Andes, rocking their base, announced it as well, in unison. With its influx the peoples woke up, and like lighting ran the opinion; from the Isthmus to Tierra del Fuego, and from Tierra del Fuego to the icy region. Everyone vowed to break the link that Nature denied to both worlds, and break the sceptre that Spain had reclined, proud, on both. Lima fulfilled this solemn vow, and, severe, her anger showed by throwing out the powerless tyrant, who had been trying to extend his oppression. On her endeavor the shackles cracked, and the furrows that she had repaired in herself stirred up her hatred and vengeance, inherited from her Inca and Lord. Countrymen, may we see her a slave no more. If for three centuries she moaned, humiliated, forever may we vow that she be free, maintaining her own splendor. Our arms, until today unarmed, be they always readying the cannon, that some day the beaches of Iberia will feel the horror of its roar. May we arouse the jealousy of Spain since it has a premonition, with want and furor, that in a contest of great nations our country will enter in comparison. On the list formed by these we shall fill the line first, ahead of the ambitious Iberian tyrant, who devastated all of America. On its summit may the Andes sustain the two-color flag or standard, may it announce to the centuries the effort that being free gave us forever. Under its shadow may we live calmly and, at the sun’s birth over its summits, may we renew the great oath we rendered to the God of Jacob.\n",

Of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness, El Salvador has always nobly dreamed. To achieve this has been her eternal proposition, To keep it, her greatest glory. With inviolable faith, she eagerly follows The way of progress In order to fulfil her high destiny And achieve a happy future. A stern barrier protects her Against the clash of vile disloyalty, Ever since the day when her lofty banner, In letters of blood, wrote “Freedom”, Wrote “Freedom”, wrote “Freedom”. Freedom is her dogma and her guide; A thousand times she has defended it, And as many times has she repelled The hateful power of atrocious tyranny. Her history has been bloody and sad, Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant, A source of legitimate glory And a great lesson in Spartan pride. Her innate bravery shall not waver: In every man there is an immortal hero Who knows how to maintain the level Of the proverbial valour of old. Valour of old, valour of old. All are self-denying and faithful To the tradition of warlike ardour With which they have always reaped fame By saving the motherland’s honour. To respect the rights of others And base her actions on right and justice Is for her, without infamous intrigue, The constant and most firm ambition. And in following this line she persists, Dedicating her tenacious efforts In giving hard battle for battle; Her happiness is found in peace, Is found in peace, is found in peace.\n",

In furrows of pain goodness germinates now goodness germinates now. O unfading glory! O immortal joy! In furrows of pain goodness germinates now. The horrible night has ceased, the sublime liberty spills the auroras of its invincible light. All humanity, moans within its chains, understands the words of He who died on the Cross. “Independence!” cries the American world; soaked in blood of heroes the land of Columbus. Still, one great principle, “The king is not sovereign”, resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. The Orinoco’s bed fills with the remains, of blood and tears a river is there seen flowing. In Bárbula they don’t know the souls nor the eyes, if admiration or horror feel or suffer. On the shores of the Caribbean, famished, the people fight, horrors preferring to treacherous health. O, aye! for Cartagena the abnegation is much, and the shambles of death its courage despises. From Boyacá in the fields, the genius of glory, for every ear a hero undefeated crowned. Soldiers without breastplate won victory; their virile breath as shield served. Bolivar crosses the Andes that two oceans bathe, swords as sparks shine in Junín. Untameable centaurs descend to the plains, and a prescience begins to be felt, of the epic the end. The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho thunders, that in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is worn for the first time, from the American sky a pavilion forming. The virgin her hairs pulls out in agony and from her beloved widowed hangs them on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes are breaking forth; constellation of cyclops its night brightened. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. But it’s not complete glory to defeat in battle, that the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. Independence alone The great clamour doesn’t silence; if the sun illuminates everyone, justice is liberty. From men the rights Nariño’s preaching, the soul of struggle prophetically taught. Ricaurte in San Mateo, in atoms flying, “Duty before life,” with flames he wrote.\"\\ncr,Costa Rica,\"Noble homeland, your beautiful flag Express for us your life: Under the limpid blue of your skies, Peace reigns, white and pure.

In furrows of pain goodness germinates now goodness germinates now. O unfading glory! O immortal joy! In furrows of pain goodness germinates now. The horrible night has ceased, the sublime liberty spills the auroras of its invincible light. All humanity, moans within its chains, understands the words of He who died on the Cross. “Independence!” cries the American world; soaked in blood of heroes the land of Columbus. Still, one great principle, “The king is not sovereign”, resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. The Orinoco’s bed fills with the remains, of blood and tears a river is there seen flowing. In Bárbula they don’t know the souls nor the eyes, if admiration or horror feel or suffer. On the shores of the Caribbean, famished, the people fight, horrors preferring to treacherous health. O, aye! for Cartagena the abnegation is much, and the shambles of death its courage despises. From Boyacá in the fields, the genius of glory, for every ear a hero undefeated crowned. Soldiers without breastplate won victory; their virile breath as shield served. Bolivar crosses the Andes that two oceans bathe, swords as sparks shine in Junín. Untameable centaurs descend to the plains, and a prescience begins to be felt, of the epic the end. The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho thunders, that in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is worn for the first time, from the American sky a pavilion forming. The virgin her hairs pulls out in agony and from her beloved widowed hangs them on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes are breaking forth; constellation of cyclops its night brightened. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. But it’s not complete glory to defeat in battle, that the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. Independence alone The great clamour doesn’t silence; if the sun illuminates everyone, justice is liberty. From men the rights Nariño’s preaching, the soul of struggle prophetically taught. Ricaurte in San Mateo, in atoms flying, “Duty before life,” with flames he wrote.\"\\ncr,Costa Rica,\"Noble homeland, your beautiful flag Express for us your life: Under the limpid blue of your skies, Peace reigns, white and pure.

No country deserves to be free If it is an indolent and servile slave, If the call does not grow loud within it, Tempered by a virile heroism. But the brave and indomitable Quisqueya Will always hold its head high, For if it were a thousand times enslaved, It would a thousand times regain liberty. If it will be exposed to ruse and deceit Unto contempt of a real imposer, On to Las Carreras! Beler! …it were places Where the traces of glory are found. Where on the top of the heroic bastion, The word of the libarated became flesh, Where the genius of Sánchez and Duarte Taught to be free or to die.

Now the roar of rough chains that we had heard for three centuries of horror from the free, at the sacred cry that the world heard astonished, ceased. Everywhere the inflamed San Martín “Liberty”, “Liberty” pronounced; and the Andes, rocking their base, announced it as well, in unison. With its influx the peoples woke up, and like lighting ran the opinion; from the Isthmus to Tierra del Fuego, and from Tierra del Fuego to the icy region. Everyone vowed to break the link that Nature denied to both worlds, and break the sceptre that Spain had reclined, proud, on both. Lima fulfilled this solemn vow, and, severe, her anger showed by throwing out the powerless tyrant, who had been trying to extend his oppression. On her endeavor the shackles cracked, and the furrows that she had repaired in herself stirred up her hatred and vengeance, inherited from her Inca and Lord.

May we arouse the jealousy of Spain since it has a premonition, with want and furor, that in a contest of great nations our country will enter in comparison. On the list formed by these we shall fill the line first, ahead of the ambitious Iberian tyrant, who devastated all of America. On its summit may the Andes sustain the two-color flag or standard, may it announce to the centuries the effort that being free gave us forever.

The horrible night has ceased, the sublime liberty spills the auroras of its invincible light. All humanity, moans within its chains, understands the words of He who died on the Cross. “Independence!” cries the American world; soaked in blood of heroes the land of Columbus. Still, one great principle, “The king is not sovereign”, resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. The Orinoco’s bed fills with the remains, of blood and tears a river is there seen flowing. In Bárbula they don’t know the souls nor the eyes, if admiration or horror feel or suffer. On the shores of the Caribbean, famished, the people fight, horrors preferring to treacherous health. O, aye! for Cartagena the abnegation is much, and the shambles of death its courage despises. From Boyacá in the fields, the genius of glory, for every ear a hero undefeated crowned. Soldiers without breastplate won victory; their virile breath as shield served. Bolivar crosses the Andes that two oceans bathe, swords as sparks shine in Junín. Untameable centaurs descend to the plains, and a prescience begins to be felt, of the epic the end. The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho thunders, that in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is worn for the first time, from the American sky a pavilion forming. The virgin her hairs pulls out in agony and from her beloved widowed hangs them on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes are breaking forth; constellation of cyclops its night brightened. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. But it’s not complete glory to defeat in battle, that the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. Independence alone The great clamour doesn’t silence; if the sun illuminates everyone, justice is liberty. From men the rights Nariño’s preaching, the soul of struggle prophetically taught.

In your emblem, which a rough sea With its wild waves protects, Behind the bare summit of a volcano, A star brightly shines. Like an Indian maiden you have been sleeping, Lulled by the resonant song of your seas, When, set in your golden valleys, The bold navigator found you; And on seeing, enraptured, your beauty, And feeling your enchantment, He dedicated a kiss of love to the blue hem of your splendid mantle. From a country where the sun rises, Beyond the blue Atlantic, That man who had dreamt you In search of you he launched to sea. When you raised your pale forehead, In the lively anxiousness of your hope, Under the gentle dome of your sky Already floated a strange banner. It was useless that your beloved Indian Rushed into the fight with ire, Because, covered with his blood, Lempira, In the deep night he sank; And of the heroic deed, in memory, The legend alone has kept A sepulcher in a forgotten place, And the severe profile of a mountain peak. For three centuries your children heard The imperious mandate of the master; For three centuries your useless complaint In the blue atmosphere was lost But one glorious day your ear Perceived, powerful and distant, That there, far away, over the Atlantic, Indignantly, a lion roared It was France, the free, the heroic, Which in its dreams of centuries slept, Awoke irate to life At the virile protest of Danton: It was France, who sent to the death The head of the consecrated King, And which built up proudly at its side, The altar of the goddess of Reason. You also, oh my country!, arose From your servile deep sleep; You also showed the world The infamous shackle destroyed. And in your blessed soil, behind the tall Hair of the wild jungle, Like a bird of black feathers, The fleeting colony was lost.

To achieve this has been her eternal proposition, To keep it, her greatest glory. With inviolable faith, she eagerly follows The way of progress In order to fulfil her high destiny And achieve a happy future. A stern barrier protects her Against the clash of vile disloyalty, Ever since the day when her lofty banner, In letters of blood, wrote “Freedom”, Wrote “Freedom”, wrote “Freedom”. Freedom is her dogma and her guide; A thousand times she has defended it, And as many times has she repelled The hateful power of atrocious tyranny. Her history has been bloody and sad, Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant, A source of legitimate glory And a great lesson in Spartan pride. Her innate bravery shall not waver: In every man there is an immortal hero Who knows how to maintain the level Of the proverbial valour of old. Valour of old, valour of old. All are self-denying and faithful To the tradition of warlike ardour With which they have always reaped fame By saving the motherland’s honour. To respect the rights of others And base her actions on right and justice Is for her, without infamous intrigue, The constant and most firm ambition. And in following this line she persists, Dedicating her tenacious efforts In giving hard battle for battle; Her happiness is found in peace, Is found in peace, is found in peace.', 'sx': 'Where over the world, say where, You find an island there, So lovely small with nations free With people French and Dutch Though talking English much, As thee Saint Martin in the sea?
