The horrible night has ceased, the sublime liberty spills the auroras of its invincible light. All humanity, moans within its chains, understands the words of He who died on the Cross. “Independence!” cries the American world; soaked in blood of heroes the land of Columbus. Still, one great principle, “The king is not sovereign”, resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. The Orinoco’s bed fills with the remains, of blood and tears a river is there seen flowing. In Bárbula they don’t know the souls nor the eyes, if admiration or horror feel or suffer. On the shores of the Caribbean, famished, the people fight, horrors preferring to treacherous health. O, aye! for Cartagena the abnegation is much, and the shambles of death its courage despises. From Boyacá in the fields, the genius of glory, for every ear a hero undefeated crowned. Soldiers without breastplate won victory; their virile breath as shield served. Bolivar crosses the Andes that two oceans bathe, swords as sparks shine in Junín. Untameable centaurs descend to the plains, and a prescience begins to be felt, of the epic the end. The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho thunders, that in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is worn for the first time, from the American sky a pavilion forming. The virgin her hairs pulls out in agony and from her beloved widowed hangs them on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes are breaking forth; constellation of cyclops its night brightened. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. But it’s not complete glory to defeat in battle, that the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. Independence alone The great clamour doesn’t silence; if the sun illuminates everyone, justice is liberty. From men the rights Nariño’s preaching, the soul of struggle prophetically taught. Ricaurte in San Mateo, in atoms flying, “Duty before life,” with flames he wrote."

The horrible night has ceased, the sublime liberty spills the auroras of its invincible light. All humanity, moans within its chains, understands the words of He who died on the Cross. “Independence!” cries the American world; soaked in blood of heroes the land of Columbus. Still, one great principle, “The king is not sovereign”, resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. The Orinoco’s bed fills with the remains, of blood and tears a river is there seen flowing. In Bárbula they don’t know the souls nor the eyes, if admiration or horror feel or suffer. On the shores of the Caribbean, famished, the people fight, horrors preferring to treacherous health. O, aye! for Cartagena the abnegation is much, and the shambles of death its courage despises. From Boyacá in the fields, the genius of glory, for every ear a hero undefeated crowned. Soldiers without breastplate won victory; their virile breath as shield served. Bolivar crosses the Andes that two oceans bathe, swords as sparks shine in Junín. Untameable centaurs descend to the plains, and a prescience begins to be felt, of the epic the end. The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho thunders, that in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is worn for the first time, from the American sky a pavilion forming. The virgin her hairs pulls out in agony and from her beloved widowed hangs them on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes are breaking forth; constellation of cyclops its night brightened. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. But it’s not complete glory to defeat in battle, that the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. Independence alone The great clamour doesn’t silence; if the sun illuminates everyone, justice is liberty. From men the rights Nariño’s preaching, the soul of struggle prophetically taught.

Where the kelp moves and swells to the wind and the tide And penguins troop down from the lonely hillside. Those isles of the sea are calling to me The smell of the camp fire a dear memory. Though far I may roam, some day I’ll come home To the islands, the Falklands, the isles of the sea. There’s a camp house down yonder I’m longing to see, Though it’s no gilded palace it’s there I would be. Just to be there again I would race o’er the foam, For that lone house so far is my own home sweet home. Now we’re off to the Falklands, so wild and so free, Where there’s tussock and kelp and the red diddle-dee, And the wild rugged beauty that thrills more than me Is bred in the bones on the isles of the sea."

In your emblem, which a rough sea With its wild waves protects, Behind the bare summit of a volcano, A star brightly shines. Like an Indian maiden you have been sleeping, Lulled by the resonant song of your seas, When, set in your golden valleys, The bold navigator found you; And on seeing, enraptured, your beauty, And feeling your enchantment, He dedicated a kiss of love to the blue hem of your splendid mantle. From a country where the sun rises, Beyond the blue Atlantic, That man who had dreamt you In search of you he launched to sea. When you raised your pale forehead, In the lively anxiousness of your hope, Under the gentle dome of your sky Already floated a strange banner. It was useless that your beloved Indian Rushed into the fight with ire, Because, covered with his blood, Lempira, In the deep night he sank; And of the heroic deed, in memory, The legend alone has kept A sepulcher in a forgotten place, And the severe profile of a mountain peak. For three centuries your children heard The imperious mandate of the master; For three centuries your useless complaint In the blue atmosphere was lost But one glorious day your ear Perceived, powerful and distant, That there, far away, over the Atlantic, Indignantly, a lion roared It was France, the free, the heroic, Which in its dreams of centuries slept, Awoke irate to life At the virile protest of Danton: It was France, who sent to the death The head of the consecrated King, And which built up proudly at its side, The altar of the goddess of Reason. You also, oh my country!, arose From your servile deep sleep; You also showed the world The infamous shackle destroyed. And in your blessed soil, behind the tall Hair of the wild jungle, Like a bird of black feathers, The fleeting colony was lost. To guard this sacred emblem We shall march, oh fatherland, to our death; Our death will be honoured If we die thinking of your love. Having defended your holy flag, And shrouded in its glorious folds, Many, Honduras, shall die for you, But shall fall in honour."

For a long time the oppressed Peruvian dragged the ominous chain; sentenced to a cruel servitude for a long time, for a long time for a long time in silence he moaned. But as soon as the sacred cry “Liberty!” was heard on its coasts, he shook off the indolence of slavery, the humiliated, the humiliated the humiliated neck he raised the humiliated neck he raised the neck he raised!. Now the roar of rough chains that we had heard for three centuries of horror from the free, at the sacred cry that the world heard astonished, ceased. Everywhere the inflamed San Martín “Liberty”, “Liberty” pronounced; and the Andes, rocking their base, announced it as well, in unison. With its influx the peoples woke up, and like lighting ran the opinion; from the Isthmus to Tierra del Fuego, and from Tierra del Fuego to the icy region. Everyone vowed to break the link that Nature denied to both worlds, and break the sceptre that Spain had reclined, proud, on both. Lima fulfilled this solemn vow, and, severe, her anger showed by throwing out the powerless tyrant, who had been trying to extend his oppression. On her endeavor the shackles cracked, and the furrows that she had repaired in herself stirred up her hatred and vengeance, inherited from her Inca and Lord. Countrymen, may we see her a slave no more. If for three centuries she moaned, humiliated, forever may we vow that she be free, maintaining her own splendor. Our arms, until today unarmed, be they always readying the cannon, that some day the beaches of Iberia will feel the horror of its roar. May we arouse the jealousy of Spain since it has a premonition, with want and furor, that in a contest of great nations our country will enter in comparison. On the list formed by these we shall fill the line first, ahead of the ambitious Iberian tyrant, who devastated all of America. On its summit may the Andes sustain the two-color flag or standard, may it announce to the centuries the effort that being free gave us forever. Under its shadow may we live calmly and, at the sun’s birth over its summits, may we renew the great oath we rendered to the God of Jacob."

It was our strength that gave us our final liberty. Neither tyrants nor slaves can continue, Where unity and equality reign, Where unity and equality reign.

Long years, during which Phoebus in the clouds Saw darken the pearl of the South, Today a grand hero appears Raising up again her glory and virtue… Europe and the world salute her with applause And also acclaim Invincible bastion of heroism, Magnificent Eden of riches. (But) when discord rumbled all around Which fatally devoured other Peoples, Paraguayans, the sacred ground Was covered by an angel with its wings. Oh, how pure, of laurel girded Sweet Fatherland, in this manner you show yourself. In your ensign one sees the colors Of sapphire, diamond, and ruby. In your coat of arms, which the Sun illuminates, Under the cap, one sees the lion. Double image of the strong and the free, And of glories, the memory and crest. From the tomb of vile feudalism The national Deity rises free; Oppressors, bend your knees! Compatriots, entone the hymn! Sound the cry, “Republic or death”! Our breasts exhale it with faith, And the mountains repeat its echoes Like giants arising. Our Fatherland defends liberty and justice; Tyrants: listen! The laws in its sacred charter Will sustain its heroism in the fight. Against the world, if the world opposes it, If the world dares to insult her security, Battling to avenge we shall know her Or die embracing her. Arise, oh People, your splendid sword That strikes with sparkles of God, There is no middle ground between free or slave And an abyss divides the two. In the gentle breezes the Hymn resounds, Repeating with triumphal echo: For the free, renowned glory! For the Fatherland, immortal laurel!"

Freedom is her dogma and her guide; A thousand times she has defended it, And as many times has she repelled The hateful power of atrocious tyranny. Her history has been bloody and sad, Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant, A source of legitimate glory And a great lesson in Spartan pride. Her innate bravery shall not waver: In every man there is an immortal hero Who knows how to maintain the level Of the proverbial valour of old. Valour of old, valour of old. All are self-denying and faithful To the tradition of warlike ardour With which they have always reaped fame By saving the motherland’s honour. To respect the rights of others And base her actions on right and justice Is for her, without infamous intrigue, The constant and most firm ambition. And in following this line she persists, Dedicating her tenacious efforts In giving hard battle for battle; Her happiness is found in peace, Is found in peace, is found in peace."
