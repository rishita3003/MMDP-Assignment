Oh we salute this land of ours Our country we declare This promised land With its beauties grand Though small it is our own : Turks and Caicos, Turks and Caicos Our country firm and free Our allegiance, Turks and Caicos We pledge and we affirm. From the east, west, north and south Our banks and oceans meet Surrounding sands and hills of glee Our pristine beauties see Our people forged and blend With multiplicity Of race and kind and creed and tongue United by our goals We stand with courage brave To maintain this land of ours With islands scattered here and there With trust in God we stand.
