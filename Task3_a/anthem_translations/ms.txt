Oh Montserrat, proud Motherland Your children raise your standard high. In toil and tears to serve you well The emerald jewel from Godâ€™s hand Oh Montserrat, by nature blest To you your children sing Come well or woe, come friend or foe To you your people cling Rise up and make our country great With art and skill and sacrifice With masque and drum we celebrate Triumphant masters of our fate We sing our land in harmony May God be her eternal guard And make Montserrat a house of hope, A haven in the Carib Sea. No fount of sadness overwhelm A people striving under God Their spirits free forevermore
