As long as we live, What foreign violence has seized, With sabres in hand we will retrieve. Under your command Unite us as a people. Cross the Vistula and Warta We shall be Poles; Bonaparte has shown us The way to victory. Like Czarniecki to Poznan, After the war with the Swede, To save our country, We shall return by sea. A father, in tears, says to his Basia: “Just listen, it seems that our people are beating the drums.”
